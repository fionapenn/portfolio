     <br><br>This work will culminate in an essay film which will be screened in May of  2019.<br><br>Here are some excerpts of essays and images that will eventually make their way into the film:</h4></div>
      <div class="quote">To align oneself with the real while intimating that others are at play, approximate, or an imitation can feel good.

I know we didn’t understand what little sex we’d had, our bodies or the bodies of our lovers, young women lost in their way too, though smarter.<br><em>an excerpt from "A Kentucky of Mothers"<br>by Dana Ward</em></div>
